## Description
My motivation for this project was to create an online store that has a function back end.

I built this project to demonstrate my ability to use pg and sequelize.

This project solved the developers inability to build a functional back end to an e-commerce site

I learned how to incorporate express, pg and sequelize to build a functional back end.
